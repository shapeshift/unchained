  description: "Tendermint supports the following RPC protocols:\n\n* URI over HTTP\n\
    * JSONRPC over HTTP\n* JSONRPC over websockets\n\n## Configuration\n\nRPC can\
    \ be configured by tuning parameters under `[rpc]` table in the\n`$TMHOME/config/config.toml`\
    \ file or by using the `--rpc.X` command-line\nflags.\n\nDefault rpc listen address\
    \ is `tcp://0.0.0.0:26657`.\nTo set another address, set the `laddr` config parameter\
    \ to desired value.\nCORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) can be enabled by setting\n\
    `cors_allowed_origins`, `cors_allowed_methods`, `cors_allowed_headers`\nconfig\
    \ parameters.\n\n## Arguments\n\nArguments which expect strings or byte arrays\
    \ may be passed as quoted\nstrings, like `\"abc\"` or as `0x`-prefixed strings,\
    \ like `0x616263`.\n\n## URI/HTTP\n\nA REST like interface.\n\n    curl localhost:26657/block?height=5\n\
    \n## JSONRPC/HTTP\n\nJSONRPC requests can be POST'd to the root RPC endpoint via\
    \ HTTP.\n\n    curl --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" --request POST\
    \ --data '{\"method\": \"block\", \"params\": [\"5\"], \"id\": 1}' localhost:26657\n\
    \n## JSONRPC/websockets\n\nJSONRPC requests can be also made via websocket.\n\
    The websocket endpoint is at `/websocket`, e.g. `localhost:26657/websocket`.\n\
    Asynchronous RPC functions like event `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` are\nonly\
    \ available via websockets.\n\nExample using https://github.com/hashrocket/ws:\n\
    \n    ws ws://localhost:26657/websocket\n    > { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\"\
    : \"subscribe\", \"params\": [\"tm.event='NewBlock'\"], \"id\": 1 }\n"
