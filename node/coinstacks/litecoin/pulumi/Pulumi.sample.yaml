## All uncommented configuration is required for local development
## Reasonable defaults are provided where applicable
## Feel free to modify as needed

config:
  unchained:litecoin:
    ## stack - reference to common stack in order to reference stack outputs (ie. kubeconfig)
    ## names must be fully qualified, including the organization, project, and stack name components
    ## format as <organization>/<project>/<stack>
    ## for individual accounts, use your account name (pulumi whoami) for the organization component.
    stack: # run `pulumi stack ls` in `unchained/pulumi` and reference the url

    ## environment - specify environment if you deployed multiples into cluster. specified as 'additionalEnvironments' in the cluster stack
    ## if falsy use default environment created in cluster stack
    #environment:

    ## network - chain network (ie. mainnet, testnet, etc.)
    network: mainnet

    ## api - if specified an api service will be deployed
    api:
      autoscaling:
        enabled: false
        cpuThreshold: 30
        maxReplicas: 2
      cpuLimit: "300m"
      cpuRequest: "300m"
      memoryLimit: "512Mi"
      replicas: 1

    ## indexer - if specified an indexer service and optional node will be deployed
    ## this is very resource intensive, so you can point at public endpoints instead of running your own.
    #indexer:
    #  cpuLimit: '2'
    #  cpuRequest: '2'
    #  memoryLimit: '8Gi'
    #  replicas: 1
